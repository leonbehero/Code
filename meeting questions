2. Key Projects to Highlight
1. TL Assistant Tool
“This tool, built in MS Access, helps Duty TLs and Supervisors manage shifts more effectively by extracting data from rota systems like NICE and organising it into a structured, filterable view. It automatically assigns break/meal times based on the tasks scheduled and allows live updates to payment limits — all designed to prevent service disruption and increase visibility.”

🎯 Skills to highlight:

Data extraction and organisation

Automation logic for time assignments

User-friendly interface design

Backend logic with Access/VBA

🔹 2. Task Assistant Tool
“Also in MS Access, this tool was designed to streamline repetitive advisor tasks. It includes ID verification, email template management, a settlement query module linked to betslip IDs, and an internal information board that provides real-time task and break updates. It’s aimed at reducing task time and standardising processes.”

🎯 Skills to highlight:

Task automation

Interface and workflow optimisation

Use of Access forms, queries, macros

🔹 3. Agent Performance Tracker
“This performance dashboard allows managers and TLs to monitor metrics like chat handling, lateness, refusals, etc. It provides historical data and team comparisons, and generates dynamic HTML reports — instead of using Access's built-in reports — to ensure broader compatibility and a cleaner format.”

🎯 Skills to highlight:

SQL queries (if used)

HTML generation from Access

Trend analysis and reporting

🔹 4. Team Development Hub
“This Excel-based hub centralises team development data — coaching, PDPs, contact review stats, and TD planning. It’s used by leaders to plan, review, and upload records, and features a dashboard view of contact review performance and TD slot allocation.”

🎯 Skills to highlight:

Dashboard design in Excel

Workflow mapping

Data tracking and organisation

🔹 5. Asian CS Website Issue Report Dashboard
“This Excel dashboard helps us visualise and analyse website issues, identifying patterns by region or ISP. It helps the management team make faster, data-driven decisions when resolving platform issues.”

🎯 Skills to highlight:

Data visualisation

Pattern recognition

Dashboard storytelling

While I’ve been in a customer service management role, these projects have allowed me to gain hands-on experience with data, automation, and tool building — areas I’m very passionate about. I’d love to explore how these technical skills could be applied and expanded further in an IT role, particularly in areas like SQL, dashboard creation, or workflow automation.
