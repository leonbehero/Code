I listed all projects/tools I have achieved here, and i need you to rewrite them into something i can use in the interview.

1st tool is TL Assistant Tool, which I created using MS Access for TL and Sup which used by them to run shift.
This tool can extract staffs rota data from Rota or NICE, and organized the data with into structure can used for running shift. for example, by selecting the date, the tool will list all staffs who worked on that day and ordered by shift start time and job titles. And the tool can highlight those work from home staffs which can distinguish work from home staffs and work in office staffs.
Duty TL and SUP can assign task tin this tool, by selecting pre-defined task from drop down list.
This tool can also automatically allocate break and meal time slots depending on tasks assigned according pre-defined plan, which could prevent service interruption caused by something like too many staffs going break at same time.
In this took, user can also update the payment limit for each payment method, which give team a visibility of current payment limits. This tool can also use the timestamp and status user updated on payment limits to automatically calculate each payment methods’ availability.
Advisor can view their today’s task, meal/break time and payment limit in a tool called task assistant I created specifically for them.


2nd tool is Task Assistant Tool, which I created using MS Access specifically for Advisor for them to boost certain tasks’ efficiency.
This is kind of toolsets, which including several sections.
1st section, in here, advisor can store their personal templates, and can switch contents between simplified and traditional Chinese with one click.
2nd section is Settlement, in this section, advisor can use betslip ID to search match results from in-play stats and rules, also can submit settlement query/request to OSS using betslip id.
3rd section is ID, in this section, advisor can verify the integrity of the ID and extract some basic information from ID, such as date of birth, gender and ID registration region.
4th section is website, in here, advisor can quickly generate website issue email.
5th section called inboard, which is kind of information board, where advisor can check their task arrangement, break and meal time, today’s duty supervisor/TL, floor walking TL, support supervisor names and current payment methods’ availability.

3rd tool is called agent performance tracker, which also built with MS Access, which is a database, mainly used by manager, supervisor and TL to track team member’s productivity.
In this tool, user can check agents weekly performance data, such as lateness, live chat handled, number of chat time outs, refused, average chat duration, and email figure and call figure.
This tool also provide a comprehensive report function, which provide each agents historical data and trends, also a comparison within a team. (ps: I didn’t use MS Access built-in feature to build this report. This report is actually an HTML file which generated by the tool)

4th tool is an MS Excel based tool, called team development hub, in which supervisor and team leader can upload all their team development documentation.
In this dashboard page, user can track selected quarter’s contact review results and progress. Also can view that team’s team development documentation, such as coaching records, PDPs etc.
Under performance stats page, manager can view selected period’s contact review statistics, which highlighted percentage of contact fall short of standard on each areas across teams.
TD Planner page, in which manager can view selected week’s TL’s TD slots arrangement, and usage.
Staff Record page, which is used for updating staff details and upload their banding documents, also in here, we can check each individual’s contact quality and their development activities.
Urgent Escalation page, in this page, team leader can log urgent escalation case (where the contact quality assessment below minimum required score, need to trigger urgent escalation, which means service incident needs to been prioritized.)
PDP page, where user can upload team member’s PDP.
Contact Review page, same as PDP, where user can upload contact review result.
Meeting log page, where user can upload meeting notes.

Asian CS Website Issue Report Dashboard – I built this Excel based dashboard for management team to analyse website issue data to find any geographic, or ISP pattern or trends.


Here’s a refined version of your projects and tools that you can use in an interview:

1. TL Assistant Tool
I developed the TL Assistant Tool using MS Access to support Team Leaders (TL) and Supervisors (Sup) in managing their shifts effectively. This tool extracts staff rota data from Rota or NICE and organises it into a structured format for easy access. By selecting a date, users can view all staff scheduled to work that day, sorted by shift start time and job title, with a clear distinction between work-from-home and in-office staff. The tool allows Duty TLs and Supervisors to assign tasks from a predefined dropdown list and automatically allocates break and meal time slots based on these tasks, preventing service interruptions. Additionally, users can update payment limits for each payment method, providing visibility into current limits, while the tool calculates the availability of each payment method based on user updates.

2. Task Assistant Tool
I created the Task Assistant Tool, also using MS Access, specifically for Advisors to enhance task efficiency. This toolset includes several sections:

Personal Templates: Advisors can store and switch between simplified and traditional Chinese templates with one click.
Settlement: Advisors can search match results using betslip IDs and submit settlement queries to OSS.
ID Verification: This section allows advisors to verify ID integrity and extract basic information such as date of birth and gender.
Website Issues: Advisors can quickly generate emails for website issues.
Inboard: An information board where advisors can check their task arrangements, break and meal times, and details about their duty supervisor and current payment methods.
3. Agent Performance Tracker
I developed the Agent Performance Tracker using MS Access, which serves as a database for managers, supervisors, and TLs to monitor team productivity. Users can access weekly performance data, including lateness, live chat handled, chat timeouts, refusals, average chat duration, and email and call figures. The tool also features a comprehensive reporting function that provides historical data and trends for each agent, as well as team comparisons. Notably, I created the report as an HTML file generated by the tool, rather than using MS Access's built-in features.

4. Team Development Hub
I designed the Team Development Hub using MS Excel, allowing supervisors and team leaders to upload all team development documentation. The dashboard enables users to track contact review results and progress for selected quarters, as well as view coaching records and Personal Development Plans (PDPs). The performance stats page highlights contact review statistics, showing the percentage of contacts falling short of standards across teams. The TD Planner page allows managers to view the arrangement and usage of TL’s TD slots for the selected week. Other features include staff record updates, urgent escalation logging for service incidents, and pages for uploading PDPs, contact review results, and meeting notes.

5. Asian CS Website Issue Report Dashboard
I built the Asian CS Website Issue Report Dashboard using Excel to assist the management team in analysing website issue data. This dashboard helps identify geographic or ISP patterns and trends, enabling informed decision-making regarding website performance.
