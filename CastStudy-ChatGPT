**Case Study: Driving Performance Excellence**

**Executive Summary**

As a Quality Assurance (QA) Deputy Manager candidate, I propose a performance improvement framework that positions QA as a strategic partner in driving service excellence, process optimisation, and product clarity. Rather than limiting QA to frontline coaching, this approach elevates its role to proactively influence cross-functional operations and customer-centric innovation. By embedding QA insights into business processes, product design, and customer experience, we aim to create a measurable, scalable, and sustainable model of continuous improvement.

**Vision:**
To measure quality at scale and drive continuous improvement across people, processes, and tools—enhancing both business performance and the customer experience.

**Objective:**
Develop a communication and improvement strategy that not only boosts agent performance but also identifies systemic gaps in internal processes and products that hinder quality service.

**1. Data Review**

To establish actionable insights, we would analyse the following data points across all contact centre locations:

* QA Scores (interaction-based)
* Audit Pass/Fail Trends
* Complaint Volume per 1,000 Contacts
* Repeat Contact Rates
* Offer-Related Query Rates
* Payment Delay Complaints
* Settlement Resolution Times (dependent on OSS and Control Desk)
* Customer Feedback & CSAT Themes

**Dummy Data Table (for Illustration):**

| Metric                       | Site A | Site B | Global Avg | Target |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| QA Score                     | 86%    | 78%    | 82%        | 90%    |
| Complaint Rate               | 2.3    | 3.7    | 3.0        | <2.5   |
| Repeat Contact Rate          | 14%    | 19%    | 17%        | <12%   |
| Offer Query Rate             | 11%    | 15%    | 13%        | <10%   |
| Avg Payment Delay Complaints | 58     | 102    | 80         | <50    |

**2. Actionable Recommendations**

**Agent-Level Preventive Measures:**

* Weekly coaching based on QA insights.
* Refresher training on top failure reasons.
* Behavioural scorecards aligned with customer-centric values.

**Agent-Level Corrective Actions:**

* Structured PDPs with milestones.
* Supervisor-led coaching for outliers using QA dashboards.
* QA Champion system to facilitate peer learning.

**Cross-Functional Preventive Measures:**

* Monthly QA-Product-OSS-Training triage to surface frequent complaint types.
* Track escalation turnaround times from support teams (e.g. Control Desk).
* Partner with Marketing to simplify offer design based on feedback themes.

**Cross-Functional Corrective Actions:**

* QA Analysts embedded in sprint reviews to advocate for clarity in process and tool design.
* Shared dashboard showing impact of upstream issues (e.g. payment delay rates, erroneous settlements).

**3. Communication Strategy**

| Audience               | Channel               | Frequency   | Objective                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Agents                 | 1:1 Scorecards        | Weekly      | Drive personalised improvement        |
| Supervisors            | QA Dashboards         | Fortnightly | Monitor trends & manage coaching      |
| Senior Leadership      | Insight Summary Decks | Monthly     | Highlight strategic improvement areas |
| Global QA Team         | Calibration Sessions  | Monthly     | Align audit standards across sites    |
| Cross-Functional Teams | Root Cause Dashboards | Monthly     | Visibility on process-related quality |

**Key Tools:** Power BI dashboards, automated QA email reports, live calibration workshops, Slack/MS Teams knowledge sharing channels.

**4. Continuous Improvement Strategy**

**Framework Used: PDCA (Plan – Do – Check – Act)**

**Plan:** Identify agent-level and systemic performance gaps using QA and complaint data.

**Do:** Implement targeted coaching plans, process redesigns, and product simplifications.

**Check:** Compare pre/post metrics including QA scores, complaints, and CSAT.

**Act:** Scale effective initiatives globally; archive ineffective actions with learnings documented.

**Innovation via QA:**

* Offer redesign: QA feedback loop with Marketing to ensure clarity.
* Process simplification: QA flags inefficient agent workflows (e.g. lengthy verification scripts).
* Brand alignment: QA helps shape customer-facing language and tone.

**5. Measuring Impact**

**KPIs:**

* QA Score Delta (Pre/Post-Coaching)
* Repeat Contact Rate Reduction
* Complaint Volume Decrease (especially in flagged categories)
* Speed of Settlement Escalation Resolution
* QA Calibration Accuracy %
* Stakeholder Feedback Scores (surveyed quarterly)

**Review Cadence:**

* Monthly QA Score & Complaint Report
* Quarterly Continuous Improvement Review (includes Product, Marketing, Ops)

**Tools:** KPI Tracker Dashboards, Quarterly Review Templates, Root Cause Registry, Stakeholder Impact Logs

**Conclusion**

Quality Assurance must serve as both a microscope and a mirror—zooming in on agent behaviour while reflecting systemic inefficiencies. By expanding QA’s remit beyond frontline audits to cross-functional collaboration and process feedback, this strategy positions the QA function as a growth engine. It aligns performance insights, operational priorities, and brand promises to deliver a truly customer-centric service model at scale.
