Mingtao Zhang
Candidate for Quality Assurance Deputy Manager
Date: June 5, 2025
Introduction: Vision & Objective
Vision: To measure quality at scale and drive continuous improvements in our people, processes, products, and tools, enhancing business performance and customer experience, while embedding a customer-oriented culture across the organisation.
Objective: As a member of the Global Quality Assurance (QA) team, this document outlines a comprehensive plan for communicating performance insights and recommendations to enhance agent, procedural, product, and overall business performance. It details a strategy for disseminating performance results, improving operational effectiveness, and addressing systemic gaps through collaboration with cross-functional teams. This submission aims to demonstrate a strategic approach to Quality Assurance, where QA acts not just as a monitor of service quality but as a catalyst for proactive optimization, innovation, and the cultivation of a customer-centric philosophy within the company's brand and image.
1. Data Review: Understanding Agent Performance Comprehensively
While actual data analysis is not required for this exercise, a thorough understanding of relevant data points is crucial for a successful QA strategy. My approach involves identifying and conceptually utilizing various data sources to build a holistic view of agent, process, product, and operational performance.
Key Data Points to Consider:
Quality Assurance (QA) Scores (Agent-Focused):
Overall scores, scores per section (e.g., Compliance, Soft Skills, Problem Resolution, Procedural Adherence).
Trend analysis of QA scores over time (per agent, team, site, language).
Calibration consistency data.
Dummy Data Example: Agent A consistently scores 95% in Compliance but averages 70% in Problem Resolution, indicating a specific coaching need.
Customer Feedback:
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores (overall, and linked to specific interactions/agents if possible).
Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Effort Score (CES).
Direct customer comments and verbatim feedback (from surveys, post-interaction feedback).
Complaint data: Volume, categories, root causes, trends (similar to the complaint analysis dashboard I previously developed). This includes complaints related to product usability, offer clarity, and process inefficiencies (e.g., payment delays).
Dummy Data Example: A spike in complaints related to "unclear offer T&Cs" following a new promotion. Consistently low CSAT for interactions involving payment queries due to perceived delays.
Operational & Process Metrics:
First Contact Resolution (FCR).
Average Handle Time (AHT) – analyzed in conjunction with quality.
Error rates (e.g., processing errors, incorrect information provided, settlement errors/obvious error rates).
Payment delay rates (time from request to completion).
Offer-related query rates (volume of queries per offer).
Efficiency of dependent teams (e.g., turnaround time for escalations to OSS/Control Desk for settlement queries).
Dummy Data Example: High settlement error rates requiring frequent intervention from OSS, impacting resolution times. Increased offer-related queries correlate with complex offer mechanics.
Agent-Related Data:
Training completion records and assessment scores.
Knowledge base usage statistics (e.g., frequently accessed articles for complex products/offers – similar to insights from the Asian Knowledgebase).
Agent feedback/surveys (on tools, processes, training, product complexity, offer clarity).
Dummy Data Example: Agents frequently accessing KB articles for a specific offer, indicating its complexity.
System, Product & Marketing Data:
System downtime or performance issues (like the Payment System Performance Monitoring Dashboard I designed).
Process adherence metrics.
Workflow bottlenecks identified.
Feedback on marketing campaigns related to offer understanding and customer expectations.
Dummy Data Example: Increased customer complaints about transaction delays correlate with reported payment system slowdowns. Marketing campaign for a new offer leads to a surge in "terms unclear" queries.
Comprehensive Understanding:
By triangulating these diverse data points, QA can move beyond agent performance to understand the "why" behind systemic issues. For example, high AHT on offer-related queries might not be an agent skill issue, but a direct result of overly complex offer terms, highlighted by agent feedback and direct customer complaints. This holistic view is essential for formulating targeted recommendations that address root causes across people, processes, and products.
2. Actionable Recommendations (Preventive & Corrective)
Based on the conceptual data review, the following are examples of preventive and corrective recommendations aimed at enhancing agent, process, product, and overall business performance. These are illustrative and would be refined based on actual data insights.
A. Enhancing Agent Performance: (Content remains largely the same as before, focused on agent coaching, training, etc.)
Corrective Recommendations:
Targeted Coaching & Personalized Development Plans (PDPs)
Skill-Specific Workshops/Refresher Training
Performance Review & Consequence Management
Preventive Recommendations:
Enhanced Onboarding & Foundational Training
Proactive Knowledge Management
Peer Mentoring & Best Practice Sharing
Pre-emptive Briefings for Changes
B. Enhancing Overall Business Performance (Addressing Process, Product & Systemic Gaps):
Corrective Recommendations:
Process Re-engineering for Identified Bottlenecks & Inefficiencies:
Trigger: High AHT in specific areas, high transfer rates, customer complaints about process complexity, high payment delay rates, inefficiencies in settlement query resolution dependent on OSS/Control Desk.
Action: Conduct root cause analysis (e.g., 5 Whys, Value Stream Mapping) with cross-functional teams (Operations, Payments, IT, OSS, Control Desk) to map current processes, identify inefficiencies, and redesign for better flow, speed, and customer experience.
Product/Offer Simplification & Clarification:
Trigger: High volume of offer-related queries, complaints about unclear T&Cs, low uptake of complex offers.
Action: Collaborate with Product and Marketing teams to review and simplify offer mechanics and T&Cs. QA provides data on common points of confusion. Recommend user testing for new offers before launch.
Tool/System Enhancements:
Trigger: Agent feedback on tool usability, system errors impacting customer interactions or leading to settlement errors, payment system performance issues.
Action: Gather detailed requirements from users and work with IT/Development teams to implement fixes or enhancements.
Knowledge Base Content Overhaul for Gaps (Process & Product):
Trigger: QA identifying incorrect information being provided due to outdated KB on processes or products, high "information not found" rates.
Action: Prioritize and update/create missing KB articles. Implement a content review cycle involving product experts.
Preventive Recommendations:
"Design for Quality" Input for New Products & Offers:
Trigger: Desire to proactively reduce customer confusion and operational strain from new launches.
Action: Establish a QA checkpoint in the product/offer development lifecycle. QA reviews proposed mechanics, T&Cs, and communication plans for potential customer friction points before launch, providing feedback to Product and Marketing.
Cross-Functional Review Before New Launches (Enhanced):
Trigger: Past issues with launches leading to increased complaints or agent confusion.
Action: Implement a "Quality Gate" process involving QA, Training, Operations, Product, Marketing, and Legal/Compliance to review all customer-facing materials, agent support documentation, and underlying processes.
Regular Process & System Audits (Broader Scope):
Trigger: Desire to maintain optimal efficiency, compliance, and identify latent risks in processes like payments or settlements.
Action: Schedule periodic end-to-end audits of key customer-impacting processes, not just agent adherence.
Collaboration with Marketing on Customer-Centric Messaging:
Trigger: Opportunity to align brand image with actual customer experience and QA insights.
Action: Share anonymized customer sentiment, common pain points, and "moments of truth" identified by QA with Marketing. Collaborate to ensure brand messaging reflects a genuine understanding of customer needs and that promotional activities are designed with clarity and ease of understanding in mind.
Closed-Loop Feedback System for Customer & Systemic Issues (Enhanced):
Trigger: Ensuring insights lead to systemic fixes in products, processes, and policies.
Action: Formalize and champion the process for channeling customer issue trends and identified systemic risks (e.g., payment vulnerabilities, settlement process flaws, confusing offer structures) from QA/CS to relevant departments (Product, IT, Marketing, Payments, Legal) for root cause resolution and tracking actions to completion.
3. Develop Communication Strategy: Regular Communication & Reporting
Effective communication of performance insights is vital for driving engagement and improvement at all levels. The strategy must be tailored to the audience, ensuring clarity, relevance, and actionability, extending beyond agent performance to include process and product quality.

4. Continuous Improvement Strategy: Addressing Gaps & Root Causes (Broader Application)
A systematic approach to continuous improvement is essential for achieving sustained performance excellence. My strategy integrates QA insights into a cycle of identifying issues, analyzing root causes, implementing solutions, and monitoring outcomes, applying this not only to agent performance but critically to internal procedures, product design, and cross-departmental collaboration.
Framework: PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) Adapted for QA (Systemic Focus)
PLAN: Identify & Analyze (Broader Scope)
Identify Performance Gaps & Systemic Issues:
Utilize data from QA audits, customer feedback, operational metrics (including payment delays, settlement error rates, offer query rates), agent feedback, and system reports.
Regularly review trends to pinpoint recurring issues in processes, products, or inter-departmental handoffs.
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for Systemic Problems:
For significant or recurring issues, conduct thorough RCA involving all affected teams.
Example: If payment delay rates are high, RCA would involve Payments team, IT, and potentially product owners if related to a feature. If offer query rates are high, involve Marketing and Product.
Develop Holistic Action Plan:
Based on RCA, define actions that may involve training, process modifications, product redesign, offer simplification, tool enhancements, or KB updates.
DO: Implement Solutions (Cross-Functional Execution)
Collaborate Extensively with Cross-Functional Teams:
Engage with Training, IT, Product, Operations, Marketing, Payments, Legal, OSS, Control Desk etc., to develop and implement solutions. This is where QA acts as a catalyst and facilitator.
Example: If offer complexity is the root cause of high queries, QA collaborates with Marketing/Product on simplification, then with Training on educating agents.
Pilot Programs for Process/Product Changes.
Communicate Changes Widely.
CHECK: Monitor & Evaluate (Broader Impact)
Track Key Metrics: Continuously monitor KPIs including those related to process efficiency (e.g., payment processing time), product usability (e.g., reduction in offer-specific queries), and inter-departmental effectiveness (e.g., settlement resolution times).
Gather Feedback on Systemic Changes.
