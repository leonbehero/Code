can you draft an self introduction of me for interview?
ChatGPT ËØ¥Ôºö
Absolutely! Here's a strong, professional self-introduction tailored for an interview for either the SQL Developer or Junior Development DBA role at bet365. You can tweak it depending on which you're interviewing for, but this works well as a flexible starting point:
‚úÖ Self-Introduction for Interview
‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Mingtao Zhang. I‚Äôve been with bet365 for over 14 years, currently working as a Customer Service Deputy Manager with a strong focus on data and process optimization. Over the years, I‚Äôve built and maintained several critical reporting and automation systems using SQL, MS Access, Excel VBA, and Python to support business operations and decision-making.
For example, I developed a Payment System Performance Monitoring Dashboard that included real-time alerts and KPIs, helping our teams detect and respond to issues more efficiently. I also created an Agent Performance Tracker database that helps drive data-informed coaching and development.
My passion lies in solving complex problems through data and building systems that make processes smarter and faster.

üí° Pro Tip for Delivery:

my department is going to be closed soon, as company has decided to exit China market. my current role is in the risk of redundancy. If interviewer ask me why i apply for this sql developer role, can you draft me an answer?
ChatGPT ËØ¥Ôºö
Absolutely ‚Äî and I'm really sorry to hear about the situation. Here's a professional, honest, and positive response you can use if the interviewer asks:
‚úÖ Why Are You Applying for This Role? (Sample Answer)
"That‚Äôs a great question. As you may know, bet365 is exiting the China market, and with that decision, my current department will be closed soon. This has understandably put my current role at risk of redundancy.
That said, this transition has given me the opportunity to think deeply about where I want to go next in my career ‚Äî and for me, it‚Äôs clear that I want to focus fully on data and technical development. Throughout my time at bet365, I‚Äôve naturally gravitated toward building SQL-based tools, automating reporting, and solving complex problems with data.
What really excites me about this SQL Developer role is that it aligns perfectly with both my skills and passions. I‚Äôve already worked with large datasets, developed performance dashboards, and optimized database workflows ‚Äî and I‚Äôm eager to take that experience further in a more technically specialized environment.
I really value the culture and high-performance standards here, and this role feels like a natural evolution of the work I‚Äôve already been doing, but with the chance to go deeper and keep growing.‚Äù
üîë Why This Works:
‚úÖ Acknowledges the redundancy professionally
‚úÖ Shows forward-looking attitude
‚úÖ Demonstrates genuine interest in the new role
‚úÖ Emphasizes alignment of skills and career goals
Would you like a version tailored for the Junior DBA role too?
ÊÇ®ËØ¥Ôºö
yes please.
ChatGPT ËØ¥Ôºö
Of course! Here's a tailored version of your answer for the Junior Development Database Administrator role ‚Äî still honest, but now more focused on your eagerness to grow in database administration:
‚úÖ Why Are You Applying for This Junior DBA Role? (Sample Answer)
"With bet365‚Äôs decision to exit the China market, my current department is being phased out, and my role is unfortunately at risk of redundancy. While that‚Äôs certainly a big change, it‚Äôs also been an opportunity for me to reflect on the direction I want to take next in my career.
I‚Äôve always had a strong interest in databases, performance optimization, and data-driven problem solving. Over the years in my current role, I‚Äôve naturally taken on more technically focused work ‚Äî building SQL-based tools, automating reporting with VBA and Python, and creating dashboards to monitor system and team performance.
What really draws me to this Junior DBA role is the chance to build on that foundation in a more structured and technically challenging environment. I‚Äôm excited about the opportunity to work with technologies like SQL Server, Google Cloud databases, and high-performance systems, and to develop my expertise through your training programme.
I already have a deep understanding of bet365‚Äôs systems and business culture, and I‚Äôm genuinely motivated to continue contributing in a new capacity while growing into a more technical specialist role."
üîç Why This Works:
‚úÖ Addresses your redundancy calmly and professionally
‚úÖ Emphasizes your interest in learning and growth
‚úÖ Connects your existing experience to the future DBA responsibilities
‚úÖ Reinforces your commitment to staying with the company
Let me know if you want to blend both versions ‚Äî for example, if you‚Äôre applying for both roles and want a flexible answer!

üé§ SQL Developer Role ‚Äì Interview Simulation
Tell me about yourself.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with bet365 for over 14 years, most recently as a Customer Service Deputy Manager, but in that role, I‚Äôve also taken a strong technical lead. I‚Äôve built and maintained SQL-based reporting systems, created MS Access databases, automated tasks using Excel VBA, and developed dashboards for real-time performance monitoring.
I‚Äôve always had a passion for data ‚Äî identifying inefficiencies, building tools to automate workflows, and using data to support better decisions. With my current department being closed due to the company‚Äôs exit from the China market, I‚Äôm excited to pursue a more focused, technical role where I can apply and grow my skills full-time as a SQL Developer.‚Äù
Why are you applying for this role now?
‚ÄúThe upcoming closure of my department due to the company‚Äôs strategic shift gave me the chance to think about where I want to go next. I realized that the part of my work I‚Äôve enjoyed most has always involved data ‚Äî building databases, optimizing queries, and developing reporting tools.
This role matches both my existing experience and the kind of work I want to do long-term. I already know bet365‚Äôs culture and high-performance environment, and I‚Äôm ready to grow technically while continuing to contribute in a new capacity.‚Äù
Can you describe a project where you worked with large datasets?
‚ÄúOne key project involved designing a Payment System Performance Monitoring Dashboard. I worked with large transaction datasets from our payment systems ‚Äî tens of millions of rows ‚Äî and used SQL to extract and summarize the data. I created alerts based on performance KPIs and visualized the results using dashboards to support real-time decision-making.
This helped us spot system bottlenecks and reduce downtime. Performance and scalability were critical, so I had to pay close attention to query optimization and data structure.‚Äù
What‚Äôs your experience with SQL Server or query optimization?
‚ÄúI‚Äôve used SQL extensively to build queries and stored procedures for custom reporting tools. For example, I developed an Agent Performance Tracker that pulled large volumes of data into an MS Access front-end with SQL logic driving the back end. I regularly rewrote queries to reduce execution time, indexed key columns, and used profiling to troubleshoot slow reports.
While I haven‚Äôt worked directly with SQL Server in a production environment, I understand the core performance principles, and I‚Äôm confident I can quickly adapt to that environment.‚Äù
Have you worked with any data visualization or BI tools?
‚ÄúYes ‚Äî I‚Äôve created dashboards in Excel that integrate with SQL-based data sources. These dashboards have been used to track team performance, customer complaints, and payment system reliability. I‚Äôm currently expanding my skills in tools like Power BI and MicroStrategy, and I‚Äôd love the chance to use them more in a professional capacity.‚Äù
How do you approach troubleshooting a slow query or performance issue?
‚ÄúFirst, I review the query execution plan to identify bottlenecks like table scans or missing indexes. I check if filtering or joins can be optimized, whether indexes exist, or if there's a better way to structure the query ‚Äî like using CTEs or limiting result sets. I also look at stats on row counts and cardinality to avoid over-fetching data unnecessarily.
In one project, I reduced a report‚Äôs runtime from 90 seconds to under 10 by optimizing joins and introducing appropriate indexes.‚Äù
Describe a situation where you had to explain a complex technical issue to non-technical stakeholders.
‚ÄúWhen I developed the Agent Tracker and forecasting models, I often had to explain how the data was being calculated ‚Äî for example, how certain KPIs were derived from multiple sources. I used simple visuals and real-world analogies to clarify what was happening ‚Äòunder the hood.‚Äô As a result, managers and team leads better understood how to use the data to improve team performance.‚Äù
Do you have experience working in an Agile or collaborative environment?
‚ÄúYes, collaboration is central to how I‚Äôve worked, especially across operational and technical teams. While I‚Äôve not been part of a formal Agile sprint structure, I‚Äôve worked in fast-paced, iterative environments where requirements can change daily ‚Äî and I‚Äôve often acted as the bridge between business and technical needs.‚Äù
How do you stay up to date with data and SQL technologies?
‚ÄúI read blogs like SQL Shack and Microsoft Docs, and I‚Äôve been working on SQL Server practice environments to expand my knowledge. I also experiment with personal projects in Python and Power BI to connect with SQL data sources and test performance strategies.‚Äù
What are your long-term career goals?
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to become a specialist in SQL development and data architecture ‚Äî someone who can help design high-performance systems and mentor others in optimizing data processes. This role is the perfect opportunity to deepen my technical expertise and grow in an area I‚Äôm truly passionate about.‚Äù
‚úÖ Bonus Tip: Questions to Ask the Interviewer
You could ask:
‚ÄúWhat kinds of projects would I be working on in the first few months?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow is performance and optimization measured for SQL developers here?‚Äù
‚ÄúIs there support for continuous learning or certifications around SQL Server or cloud databases?‚Äù
Would you like to simulate a technical round or go deeper into any of the answers? I can also help you prep for a live Q&A or whiteboard-style exercise.
ÊÇ®ËØ¥Ôºö
if interviewer ask me my biggest weakness, how do i answer it?
ChatGPT ËØ¥Ôºö
Great question ‚Äî this one trips a lot of people up because you want to be honest without undermining your credibility.
Here's a version of the ‚Äúbiggest weakness‚Äù answer that‚Äôs authentic, reflective, and safe for a technical role like SQL Developer or Junior DBA ‚Äî especially given your strong background:
‚úÖ Sample Answer: ‚ÄúWhat is your biggest weakness?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd say one of my weaknesses has been being too detail-focused ‚Äî especially when working with data. I have a tendency to double- and triple-check things before handing them over, which sometimes slows me down a bit. In the past, this came from a desire to be absolutely certain everything was perfect, especially in critical reporting.
However, I‚Äôve learned to balance that by setting time boundaries, using peer reviews more effectively, and trusting the process I've built. It‚Äôs helped me deliver quality work without getting too caught up in perfection ‚Äî and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm always working to improve.‚Äù
üîç Why This Works:
‚úÖ Honest ‚Äî You‚Äôre admitting something real.
‚úÖ Low Risk ‚Äî Doesn‚Äôt question your capability or technical knowledge.
‚úÖ Shows Self-Awareness ‚Äî You‚Äôre reflecting on it and taking steps.

Absolutely ‚Äî here's a mock interview simulation tailored specifically for the Junior Development Database Administrator (DBA) role at bet365, based on:
Your technical background and resume
The job description
Your current redundancy situation
This mock simulates a realistic Q&A scenario where you'd be interviewed by a technical manager or senior DBA. Let‚Äôs get into it:
üé§ Junior DBA Interview Simulation ‚Äì bet365
Tell us a bit about yourself and your background.
‚ÄúSure. I‚Äôve been with bet365 for over 14 years, currently as a Customer Service Deputy Manager. While my core responsibilities involve operations and team leadership, I‚Äôve spent much of my time working on data solutions and automation projects.
I‚Äôve built SQL-based tools, designed MS Access databases, and created Excel VBA automation to improve reporting efficiency. These experiences sparked a strong interest in database systems and performance ‚Äî and with my department being phased out due to the China market exit, this has become the perfect time to move into a more technical, database-focused role.
I‚Äôm very excited about the opportunity to formally train and grow into a full-time DBA, and I already bring a solid foundation in SQL, data logic, and system thinking.‚Äù
Why do you want to move into a DBA role specifically?
‚ÄúOver the years, I‚Äôve naturally gravitated toward the technical side of my work ‚Äî building reporting tools, optimizing queries, and solving process issues through automation.
I realized I really enjoy working with data at its core ‚Äî understanding its structure, performance, and flow through systems. The DBA role is the perfect direction for me because it allows me to go deeper into those areas, and bet365‚Äôs data environment ‚Äî with high transaction volume and performance focus ‚Äî is exactly where I want to grow and challenge myself.‚Äù
What is your experience with SQL?
‚ÄúI‚Äôve used SQL extensively in my current role, primarily for reporting, data extraction, and performance tracking. I‚Äôve written queries that pull from large datasets ‚Äî often millions of rows ‚Äî to power dashboards and automate workflows.
For example, I created a Payment System Performance Dashboard using SQL to extract transaction-level data. I also built an Agent Performance Tracker using SQL and MS Access to centralize and automate performance reports across the team.‚Äù
Have you ever had to troubleshoot a slow query or performance issue?
‚ÄúYes. One example was when a report was taking far too long to generate for our weekly review. After reviewing the SQL, I found unnecessary joins and filters that could be optimized. I refactored the query to only pull essential columns, indexed a key column, and rewrote parts of the logic using subqueries instead of multiple joins. That brought the runtime down from over a minute to under 10 seconds.
While I haven‚Äôt worked in a formal query tuning environment yet, I apply logic and performance principles wherever I can ‚Äî and I‚Äôm eager to deepen those skills with more advanced tools and support.‚Äù
What steps would you take if a production database started running slow?
‚ÄúAt this stage, I‚Äôd start by checking basic resource usage ‚Äî CPU, memory, and I/O activity. Then I‚Äôd review slow-running queries using execution plans, check for blocking sessions, and look into recent deployments or jobs that may have caused a spike.
While I haven't yet managed a live production environment, I understand the fundamentals and would rely on senior team members and monitoring tools for guidance while I continue learning.‚Äù
You mentioned your role may be made redundant ‚Äî how are you feeling about that transition?
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely a big change, but I see it as an opportunity. I‚Äôve known for some time that I wanted to focus more deeply on the technical side of my work, so this shift gave me the push to pursue that direction fully. I already know the company, the culture, and the fast-paced expectations ‚Äî and now I‚Äôm excited to bring that familiarity into a more technical, specialized role.‚Äù
How do you manage learning new technologies while working full time?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm someone who enjoys self-learning and hands-on exploration. For example, outside of work I‚Äôve been setting up practice environments using SQL Server and BigQuery to experiment with query optimization and data structuring.
I also learn a lot from solving real problems ‚Äî like when I needed to automate manual reports with VBA and SQL, I taught myself those tools through documentation and small-scale testing. I‚Äôm very self-motivated when it comes to building technical knowledge.‚Äù
This role requires strong attention to detail. Can you give an example where that was important?
‚ÄúAbsolutely. One key example was when I built the Agent Tracker database. I had to make sure the KPIs and calculations aligned exactly with business rules. A small mistake could result in incorrect performance reporting, so I created validation steps, tested against sample data, and had stakeholders review the logic.
That level of detail helped ensure the reports were trusted and actionable ‚Äî and I apply the same mindset in all data-related work.‚Äù
How do you prioritize tasks when multiple people are waiting on data or fixes?
‚ÄúI usually prioritize based on urgency and business impact. If a request is tied to real-time operations or reporting that affects leadership decisions, that goes first. I also set expectations early and communicate clearly with stakeholders ‚Äî explaining when something is complex or if there‚Äôs a more efficient solution available.
I believe clear communication is as important as technical skill when managing multiple requests.‚Äù
What are your long-term goals in data and tech?
‚ÄúMy long-term goal is to become a well-rounded Database Administrator ‚Äî someone who understands both the technical inner workings of high-performance systems and the bigger picture of how data supports the business.
I want to be the person developers and analysts rely on for reliable, fast, and scalable data systems, and I‚Äôd eventually like to explore cloud platforms like Google Cloud or Azure as part of that journey.‚Äù

please tie it into a STAR repose for the project which I extract information from NICE and transform them into data structured for shift running which stored them into an MS Access based tool i developed using for shift running (resource manager, break/meal time manager, etc), also add automatic break/lunch time generator to the tool, which saved many human efforts on assigning break/lunch slots in line with the business needs. (background of the project: we migrate rota from original rota system to NICE, the report format, and layout, structure is very different from the old rota. In addition, we are introducing self-manage break/meal time, which makes the slot assigning is more important than before. I only got 2 weeks to get these things done, before we officially using NICE. so i worked with resource and planning team to quickly understand the functions of NICE, analyze the report structure downloaded form NICE, worked out a way to transform raw data into a format can be used for shift running. also design a function which can automatically allocate break/meal slots to staffs depending on their tasks. I break down this into different small parts, such as Data transforming, break/meal time slots automatically allocation functions, etc and prioritize those key functions, set up a deadline for each task, and regularly communicate with manager to clear expectations, and also gather feedback from users when it's live. the project is very successful as a result.)

This is a fantastic example ‚Äî rich with technical depth, real business impact, and strong demonstration of adaptability, prioritization, and execution under pressure. Here‚Äôs your full STAR response, polished and tailored for interview use, specifically for the competency:
‚ÄúAbility to work to deadlines in a continually changing, reactive environment.‚Äù
‚úÖ STAR Interview Response
‚≠ê SITUATION:
Earlier this year, we migrated our rota system to NICE, replacing the old system we‚Äôd been using for years. The new report format, layout, and structure from NICE were completely different, and we also introduced a self-managed break and meal policy, which meant we had to find a smarter way to manage and assign break/meal slots based on business needs.
üéØ TASK:
I was given just two weeks to build a working solution that would help the Resource & Planning team run shifts efficiently. The existing manual process would not work with NICE‚Äôs structure, and there was no time to wait for a permanent system to be developed. So I took the lead on designing and developing a custom tool in MS Access to handle this.
üõ†Ô∏è ACTION:
I broke the project into clear, manageable parts ‚Äî including data extraction and transformation from NICE, designing an Access-based shift-running tool, and developing an automated break/meal time allocator.
I first worked closely with the Resource & Planning team to understand the logic and functions behind NICE.
Then I analyzed the raw data from NICE reports, built SQL queries and transformation logic to convert that into a structured format suitable for operational use.
I designed the shift-running tool in MS Access, incorporating features like Resource Manager, Break/Lunch Slot Manager, and the automatic allocation function.
Throughout, I prioritized critical functionality, set internal deadlines, and kept close communication with the manager to ensure expectations were aligned.
Once live, I gathered feedback from users and quickly made adjustments to ensure smooth adoption.
‚úÖ RESULT:
The project was delivered on time ‚Äî within 2 weeks ‚Äî and it‚Äôs now actively used for running shifts and assigning break/meal times efficiently. The automatic allocation function alone saved hours of manual effort each week and ensured better alignment with business requirements, especially under the new self-managed break structure. It was a great success, especially under the tight timeline and changing operational demands.
